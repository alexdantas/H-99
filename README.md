# H-99: Ninety-Nine Haskell Problems

These are my attempts to solve each and every one of the
Ninety-Nine Haskell Problems.

You can find them [at the haskell.org's wiki][0].

They're divided into these categories:

* 1-28: Lists
* 31-41: Arithmetic
* 46-50: Logic and codes
* 54A-69: Binary trees
* 70B-73: Multiway trees
* 80-89: Graphs
* 90-99: Miscellaneous problems

Note that I'm not solving them in order.
