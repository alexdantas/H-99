-- Problem 37
-- Calculate Euler's totient function phi(m) (improved).
--
-- See problem 34 for the definition of Euler's totient function.
-- If the list of the prime factors of a number m is known in the
-- form of problem 36 then the function phi(m) can be efficiently
-- calculated as follows: Let ((p1 m1) (p2 m2) (p3 m3) ...) be the
-- list of prime factors (and their multiplicities) of a given
-- number m. Then phi(m) can be calculated with the following
-- formula:
--
-- phi(m) = (p1 - 1) * p1 ** (m1 - 1) *
--          (p2 - 1) * p2 ** (m2 - 1) *
--                   (p3 - 1) * p3 ** (m3 - 1) * ...
--
--                   Note that a ** b stands for the b'th power
--                   of a.
