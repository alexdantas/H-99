-- Problem 41
-- Given a range of integers by its lower and upper limit, print
-- a list of all even numbers and their Goldbach composition.
--
-- In most cases, if an even number is written as the sum of two
-- prime numbers, one of them is very small. Very rarely, the
-- primes are both bigger than say 50. Try to find out how many
-- such cases there are in the range 2..3000.
--
-- Example:
--
-- *Exercises> goldbachList 9 20
-- [(3,7),(5,7),(3,11),(3,13),(5,13),(3,17)]
-- *Exercises> goldbachList' 4 2000 50
